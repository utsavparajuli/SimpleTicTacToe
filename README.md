# SimpleTicTacToe

This program will emulate a simple Tic Tac Toe game. It is created primarily using two dimensional arrays, where each position in the board is specified by a certain index for the array.

The user is able to choose options from the main menu, and start playing.

The user will be prompted to enter their name whether they're playing in a two player mode or against the CPU.

The program will display the tic tac toe board and you can enter the position and will check if the spot is open and only place if it is. 

The program will constantly check if there is a winner with every move.

The moves of the CPU are randomized and will go through the same kind of error checking process.
